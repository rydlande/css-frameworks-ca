I made a social media application that can be used for whatever you like. It has some color-pop in purple and blue tones, so it might be more appealing for a younger crowd. I also used a lot of white, to get a clean aesthetic and not a messy page with to many eyecatchers. To see the profile page just enter a random username an "password" with at least 8 characters or just use the "registrer" button. You will see the feed when you go to home, by clicking "Blogify". Let me know what you think.
